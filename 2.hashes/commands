A hash in Redis is like a small key-value store within a key.
Useful for storing objects (like user profiles, product details) as fields with values.
Common commands: HSET, HGET, HGETALL, HDEL, HEXISTS, HINCRBY, etc.

Get a single Field: HGET user:1000 name
Get All: HGETALL user:1000
If Field Exists: HEXISTS user:1000 age
Delete a Field: HDEL user:1000 city
Increment a numeric field: HINCRBY user:1000
